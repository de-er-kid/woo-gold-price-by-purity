Add a global price per 1 gram of Gold, Silver, and Platinum and then use the weight of each product to automatically calculate its price based on this rate.

== Description ==

Establishing a global price per gram of Gold, Silver, and Platinum and utilizing the weight of each product, the price can be automatically calculated based on this rate, making the pricing process more efficient and accurate for all Woo-Commerce simple products and variable products.

- Establishing a global price per 1 gram of Gold, Silver, and Platinum: This involves determining a consistent price for each gram of these metals across the world, which can be used as a reference rate for calculating the price of products that contain these metals.
- Setting up the rate for each metal: This means determining the price for one gram of Gold, Silver, and Platinum based on factors like market demand, supply, and other economic factors that influence the price of these metals. Once these rates are established, they can be used as a reference rate for calculating the price of products containing these metals.
- Utilizing the weight of each product: The weight of a product plays a significant role in determining its price. By utilizing the weight of each product, the global rate per gram of the respective metal can be applied to automatically calculate the price of the product.
- Automatic price calculation: With the global price per gram of Gold, Silver, and Platinum established and the weight of the product identified, the price can be automatically calculated based on this rate. This eliminates the need for manual calculations and ensures that pricing is consistent across products.
- Compatibility with Woo-Commerce simple products and variable products: This process can be applied to both simple products (products with fixed weights) and variable products (products with different weights or sizes). This makes the pricing process more efficient and accurate for all products sold on the Woo-Commerce platform.
